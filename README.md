# K-nearest-neighbour-classification-knn-
K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a simple, instance-based machine learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest points in the training set, using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean). Itâ€™s non-parametric and works well for small, well-separated datasets.
